# Timber/ Kotlin Live Templates

Collection of Live Templates for Android Studio that make writing log statements easier than typing everything by hand.
Designed for fast logging completion with Timber in Kotlin (currently)

### Usage:
Import `LogTimberKotlin.xml` file into your Android Studio config folder (`/config/templates`) and you are good to go. 

You may have to restart Android Studio so that it can pick up new Live Template group - especially on Windows.

### Note:
Work in Progress, need to work more with those for a while to come up with satisfying feature group and consistent keyboard shortcuts. And proper readme lol
