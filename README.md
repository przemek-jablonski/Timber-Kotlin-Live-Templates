# Timber/ Kotlin Live Templates

Collection of Live Templates for Android Studio that make writing log statements easier than typing everything by hand.


Import `LogTimberKotlin.xml` file into your Android Studio config folder (`/config/templates`) and you are good to go.


Work in Progress, need to work more with those for a while to come up with satisfying feature group and consistent keyboard shortcuts. And proper readme lol
